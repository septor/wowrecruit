# IMPORTANT!!!

Before this plugin or menu item will work correctly with e107 you will need to rename the directory you're presented with to `wowrecruit_menu`.
If you are not comfortable with doing this you will need to wait until I push a release to [plugins.e107](http://plugins.e107.org/).


# WoW Recruitment Menu

Allows you to define which classes your guild needs. Configuration is done via editing `wowrecruit_menu.php`, for now.
